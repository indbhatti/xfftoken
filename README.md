# XFF Token

Welcome to the XFF Token project and the Internet Computer development community! This README provides an overview of the project and instructions to help you get started with development.

---

## Project Overview
XFF Token is a cutting-edge project built on the Internet Computer platform. It comes with a fully functional frontend and backend, empowering developers to quickly deploy and test their token-based applications. Use this repository as a foundation to customize and scale your project.

---

## Directory Structure
Explore the project directory to familiarize yourself with its layout:

- **Backend Canister:** Contains the logic for managing tokens.
- **Frontend:** A fully functional React-based frontend interface.
- **Configuration Files:** Default settings and deployment configurations.

Customize these files to match your development needs.

---

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

- [DFX SDK](https://smartcontracts.org/docs/developers-guide/install-upgrade-remove.html)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later)
- npm or yarn

---

## Getting Started

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd xff-token/
   ```

2. **Explore available commands:**

   ```bash
   dfx help
   dfx canister --help
   ```

---

## Running the Project Locally

To test your project locally:

1. **Start the Internet Computer replica:**

   ```bash
   dfx start --background
   ```

2. **Deploy canisters and generate the candid interface:**

   ```bash
   dfx deploy
   ```

   Once the deployment is complete, your application will be available at:
   
   [http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}](http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id})

3. **Make frontend changes and start the development server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend will be served at:
   
   [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

4. **Generate a new candid interface if backend changes are made:**

   ```bash
   npm run generate
   ```

   This ensures the frontend reflects the latest backend updates.

---

## Deployment to Production

Before deploying your frontend code in a production environment:

- Ensure `DFX_NETWORK` is set to `ic` if you are using Webpack.
- Replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in autogenerated declarations using one of the following methods:
  - Set `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override` to a string in `dfx.json`.
  - Write a custom `createActor` constructor for more control.
